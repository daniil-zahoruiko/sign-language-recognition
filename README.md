# Sign language recognition

This app does live recognition of different American Sign Language Alphabet signs with additional signs for space and delete.
<br>
Currently, there is only a model that recognizes the signs on images with 99% accuracy.

# Technologies and tools used:
- Tensorflow 2
- Keras API
- Google Colab
- [Dataset used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashishsau/aslamerican-sign-language-aplhabet-dataset)

The trained model can be found [here](model/sign-language-model.keras)
